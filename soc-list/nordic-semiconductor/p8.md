# P8
The P8 smartwatch is very similar in hardware to the PineTime.
The important difference though is that some components may be replaced by other.
So many revisions found in the market with a little different peripherals.

## General Information
Due to the shared hardware between this watch and the PineTime, a lot of the information on [the PineTime wiki](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PineTime) can be used for P8 development.
### Touch Panel
There are two versions of the P8 with different touch panels. One version has the Hynitron CST816S touch controller, with the other having the CST716S.

To see which version you have on the stock firmware, you can look at the _about_ page. There will be a string that looks like `00 B4 00 02`. Ending in `01` means you have the CST816S, and ending in `02` means you have the CST716S. Alternatively, swipe behaviour can determine which you have. If you swipe and keep your finger on the display, the CST716 will not register the swipe until after your finger has been removed, whereas the CST816S will register the swipe before your finger has been removed.

The CST716S also has a slightly different display, which exhibits temporary burn-in in some circumstances.

The CST816S is more desirable because it has the ability to wake from a sleeping state (where its current draw will be negligible). The CST716S cannot wake from this state and so to have tap-to-wake behaviour, you must settle with a ~3mA current draw in keeping the controller in a standby state.

So far PineTime devkits have only shipped with the CST816S.

## Development Efforts
### ATCWatch
- https://github.com/atc1441/ATCwatch
- Written by [Aaron Christophel](https://github.com/atc1441/)
- Uses LVGL for graphics
- Can be compiled for both P8 and PineTime (select version in pinout header)
- Getting the Arduino IDE working on Windows is as simple as downloading and extracting the rar from [here](https://atcnetz.de/downloads/D6Arduino.rar)
  - For Linux, the tutorial [here](https://github.com/0x416c6578/ATCwatch/blob/master/linux-tutorial.md) can be followed
- Having an Arduino build environment allows you to develop for both the PineTime and P8, and you can take advantage of nicer editors like VSCode for code completion and inspection

### p8-firmware
- https://github.com/0x416c6578/p8-firmware
- An Arduino based firmware based off ATCwatch
- Useful as a documentation resource to see how ATCwatch works, since a lot of the code is reused and explained

### PineTime Development
- Since the hardware is shared with the PineTime, a lot of the development effort put into that device can be used for the P8
- InfiniTime port to P8 in beta stage: [Link](https://github.com/JF002/InfiniTime/issues/62)
- See [the PineTime wiki](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PineTime) for more information

## Internal Photos

- This is the inside of a development watch with wires soldered to the SWD port, and a connector for easily connecting/disconnecting the battery
- Getting into the watch is rather difficult since the back is very well glued on
  - To get inside it is recommended to heat the enclosure to the point at which it is _just_ too hot to touch, then using a blade, pry off the back plastic cover
  - If you would like to re-use a dissassembled p8 then remove the old adhesive from the channel, and fill it with silicone adhesive, before pushing the back on and letting dry
    - It is better to use a lot of adhesive and just wipe excess away if you want the watch to be somewhat water-resistant
